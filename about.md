Hi there,

my name is Johannes and I'm a front-end architect currently living in WÃ¼rzburg, Germany.

What amazes (besseres wort, zu blah) me about this job is that (almost) every day I'm given a new set of tools and it's up to me to find the best suited solution for the project I'm currently working on. 

 like going from a blank page to a final product you can actually interact with. It's the feeling of creating something from scratch which I enjoy the most. (if `bower install  && npm install` still counts as 'from scratch') :)

some trivia:

- I have the odd talent (skill?) to memorize nearly every shortcut for every program I use and my colleagues like to keep making use of this. "Hey... how do I toggle the DevTools position again?"  
- I like the sound of rain and for whatever reason I enjoy pronouncing the word YAML front-matter in a weird way  
- I broke my arm once  

will ich noch reinpacken:  

- arbeiten im team find ich top  
- specialiazed in html,css,etc
