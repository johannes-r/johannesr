I'm passionate about making it as fast, easy and pleasant as possible for people to use your app. I love tackling complex tasks and flows and make them feel simple. I put time, care and attention [into everything][everything] I deliver. 

### Das ist Überschrift 3

The only problem with this is that, on a Mac, at least, there is no shortcut for a zero-width spaces. Copying and pasting it—which, as you can imagine, is quite difficult—from Wikipedia is too much effort to even bother…  
I’ve long been a fan of iOS’ (and now Mavericks’) keyboard shortcut mappings, so I decided to make use of these again. I’ve mapped the following pairs:

{% highlight ruby %}
def add_person_to_project_check_box(person, company)
  content_tag(:label, 
    check_box_tag("people_ids[]", person.id, false, { :class => "company_#{company.id}_person" }) +
    " " + person.name
  ) + tag(:br)
end
{% endhighlight %}
